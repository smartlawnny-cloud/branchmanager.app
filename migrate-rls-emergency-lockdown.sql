-- ============================================================================
-- Branch Manager — RLS EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN (Apr 29, 2026 late evening)
--
-- The previous migrate-rls-token-gateway.sql dropped the policies named
-- "Anon read quotes" / "Anon read invoices" but did NOT touch the duplicate
-- anon_all_* policies that exist under different names. Verification SELECT
-- after the first migration revealed:
--
--   anon_all_quotes      ALL    USING(true) WITH CHECK(true)   ← still wide open
--   anon_all_invoices    ALL    USING(true) WITH CHECK(true)   ← still wide open
--   anon_all_clients     ALL    USING(true) WITH CHECK(true)   ← PII massacre
--   anon_all_jobs        ALL    USING(true) WITH CHECK(true)
--   anon_all_team        ALL    USING(true) WITH CHECK(true)   ← employee data
--   anon_all_time        ALL    USING(true) WITH CHECK(true)   ← payroll
--   anon_read_tenants    SELECT USING(true)                    ← stripe key in config!
--   anon_read_requests   SELECT USING(true)
--   anon_select_communications SELECT USING(true)              ← every SMS/call log
--   anon_read_user_tenants SELECT USING(true)
--   ...plus competitors, vehicles*, location_pings, detected_locations,
--      team_messages, vehicle_positions
--
-- These were never in checked-in migration files. Ran directly in SQL editor
-- at some point.
--
-- This migration drops every anon policy that isn't intentionally there for
-- public customer-facing flows (book.html / approve.html via the new edge
-- fns / pay.html via the new edge fns). After this runs, the only legit
-- anon policies remaining should be:
--
--   services    "anon_read_services"        SELECT TRUE          (catalog)
--   requests    "Anon insert requests"      INSERT status='new'  (book.html)
--
-- approve.html and pay.html no longer need any anon policy at all — they go
-- through quote-fetch / quote-update / invoice-fetch which use service-role.
--
-- Tenants config: dropped anon read entirely. tenants.config.stripe_secret_key
-- was readable by anon-key holders. Stripe redirect-to-attacker territory.
