# deploy-fn.sh — safe edge function deploy with smoke test
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy-fn.sh <function-name>
#
# Why this script exists (May 2 2026):
# Twice today the dialpad-webhook function was deployed without the
# --no-verify-jwt flag. Each time, BM silently dropped every Dialpad
# webhook (401 UNAUTHORIZED_NO_AUTH_HEADER) for ~14 hours combined.
# Lead pipeline was offline. Doug found out by trying to use the app
# and noticing his Stripe SMS hadn't appeared.
#
# This script:
# 1. Knows which functions need verify_jwt=false (the webhook receivers
#    and public-facing endpoints) and passes the flag automatically.
# 2. Smoke-tests the function after deploy, asserting the response is
#    NOT 'UNAUTHORIZED_NO_AUTH_HEADER'.
# 3. Fails loudly if smoke test fails.
