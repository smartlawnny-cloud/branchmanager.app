### Age rating
- [ ] Run questionnaire — answer "None" to all (no violence, no profanity, no gambling, no medical info, etc.)

### App Review Information (CRITICAL — skipping these = instant reject)
- [ ] **Sign-in Required**: Yes

      Email: `apple-reviewer@branchmanager.app` (create this account in BM with read+write access to a demo tenant)
      Password: (set strong, write it down)
- [ ] **Notes for reviewer**:
      "Branch Manager is a B2B operations platform for tree service companies.
       Sign in with the demo credentials above. The demo tenant is pre-populated
       with sample clients, quotes, jobs, and routes. Test scheduling by creating
       a job, test quoting by drafting a quote and approving via the customer
       portal link, test crew GPS via the Operations → Map tab.

       Multi-tenant architecture: each tree service company has isolated data
       via Supabase Row-Level Security. The demo account is scoped to a
       sandbox tenant. Real customers self-onboard via the company website."
- [ ] **Contact info**: your name + email + phone (Apple may call about issues)

## Phase D — Build + submit

### Test build (before review)
- [ ] In Xcode: Product → Destination → Any iOS Device (arm64)
- [ ] Product → Archive
- [ ] When done: Window → Organizer → select archive → Distribute App → App Store Connect → Upload
- [ ] Wait for processing (10-30 min)
- [ ] In App Store Connect → TestFlight → add internal testers (yourself + crew)
- [ ] Install via TestFlight, USE THE APP daily for 3-7 days, fix any crashes
- [ ] Sentry will show any crashes that happen in TestFlight

### Submit
- [ ] App Store Connect → App Store tab → "+ Version or Platform" → 1.0.0
- [ ] Attach the build that's been TestFlight tested
- [ ] Fill in Version Information (description, screenshots, promo, privacy URL)
- [ ] App Review Information (demo credentials!)
- [ ] Submit for Review
- [ ] Wait 24-72h for review

### After approval
- [ ] Manually release OR auto-release on approval
- [ ] Monitor Sentry for first-week crash spike
- [ ] Respond to early App Store reviews

## Phase E — Common rejection reasons (avoid)

1. **Guideline 4.2 Minimum Functionality** — "this is just a website wrapper"
   - **Mitigation**: app uses Camera, GPS, Photos natively. Highlight in description.
2. **Guideline 5.1.1(v) Account Sign-in** — sign-in required without demo credentials
   - **Mitigation**: Demo account in App Review Information.
3. **Guideline 2.3.10 Accurate Metadata** — screenshots don't match app
   - **Mitigation**: Take screenshots from the actual running app.
4. **Guideline 1.5 Developer Information** — no support URL or contact
   - **Mitigation**: branchmanager.app live, support email visible.
5. **Multi-tenant SaaS confusion** — "this looks like multiple businesses sharing one app"
   - **Mitigation**: Frame as "B2B platform" in description; demo only ONE tenant.
